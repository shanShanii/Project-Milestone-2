				<p> News Flash: As soon as you step outside, you will burn to ashes -
				If we don't do anything about the current state of climate change, this 
				could happen in a few years taking place on Earth, our planet. Climate Change is the
				long-term change in temperatures and weather patterns. Both internal and external 
				factors contribute to this. As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, 
				it traps the sun's heat. This would eventually lead to Global warming, which would 
				have a major impact on all of us.

				but can also include acidifying rain, chemical spills, greenhouse gases and toxic waste disposal.
